description: The first idea of this little story was suggested to the author by a
  printed account of a trial which actually took place, early in the present century,
  in the United States... It may not be amiss to add, for the benefit of incredulous
  readers, that all the ''improbable events'' in the story are matters of fact, taken
  from the printed narrative. Anything which ''looks like truth'' is, in nine cases
  out of ten, the invention of the author.
